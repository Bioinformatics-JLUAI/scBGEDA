## Architecture
![Image text](https://github.com/wangyh082/scBGEDA/blob/main/frame.jpg)

## Requirements

scBGEDA is written in Python3 and requires the following dependencies to be installed:

Tensorflow 1.14

Keras 2.2

## Data availability

The real single-cell RNA-seq datasets and source codes for our analyses are freely available at (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16943722.v1)

## Usage

The dataset "Adam" is given as an example. 

First, you can run the following code in your command lines:

python SDDA.py 

You can will obtain ten mat files in ten random seeds. Then you can run the main.m to get the clustering result for "Adam" dataset.
